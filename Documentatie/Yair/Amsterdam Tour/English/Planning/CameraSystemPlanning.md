## Starting out:  

Looking for pieces from multiple videos, looking for the functions that I want to make, grabbing them and connecting them together in the same script until I finish making the system for the camera. 

## Functions I am planning to make:

1. Movement for the camera: 
I want to make the camera be able to move with one finger on the screen, making sure to give the freedom to the player to look at whatever they want.

2. Zoom feature:
	I want to make it so the player can zoom in or out, so they can see details on the map to find their way to where they need to go.

3. Bounds feature: 
I want to make it so the camera doesn’t escape from the map, making sure the player doesn’t lose sight of anything.

## Bugs?:

If there are any bugs, I will try to fix them instantly, if it gets too long, I will leave it for later, and make a to do for it.

## First week: 

In the first week of the sprint, I will start with looking for information on the features I want to add to the camera system, then combine them and see how it works first.

## Second week:

In the second week of the sprint, I will seek feedback from my group, if it looks good and what could be changed or could be added, then add what is needed to change the flesh out what I already have and optimize it to what is needed, finishing with the whole system by then.
