## Starting out

The idea was to make a button that isn't connected to the UI, I wanted it to be used to call specif scripts when it's activated, I had the idea of using the Unity Event system, and using screen touch controls that I have used before.  
  
## Functions I am planning to make:

1. Interaction, a way to interact with the object when you touch the screen, using the Unity Event system, it will call a function that is meant to open up an UI panel.  
  
2. Usable, making it possible to used only when certain condition is met.

## Bugs?:

If there are any bugs, I will try to fix them instantly, if it gets too long, I will leave it for later, and make a to do for it.

## First Week

In the first week I would just start into programming, as I already knew what I wanted, I just needed to combine them together.
